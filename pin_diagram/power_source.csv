Component,Power Source,Connection Details,Notes
Battery Pack (4x 3.7V),-,Positive lead connects to one input of the Power-On Switch. Negative lead connects directly to the Buck Converter's GND and Breadboard GND Rail.,Provides the main unregulated voltage (~14.8V max) for the system. Ensure correct polarity.
Power-On Switch,Battery Pack,Connected in series on the positive lead between the Battery Pack + and the Buck Converter's Input +.,Physically cuts power to the entire system.
Buck Converter (MP1495),Battery Pack,Input + from Battery + (via Power Switch). Input GND from Battery -.,Steps down battery voltage to 5V. Adjust the output voltage to 5.0V before connecting loads.
Buck Converter Output,-,Output +5V and GND connect to the Breadboard's + and -" (GND) power rails, respectively.",This creates the main 5V power distribution rail for sensitive electronics.
Capacitors (100uF),Buck Converter Input/Output,Connect several across the Buck Converter's Input +/GND and Output +5V/GND.,Help smooth the voltage and reduce noise/ripple.
Raspberry Pi Zero 2W,Buck Converter (5V Rail),Connect Pi's 5V pin to Breadboard + Rail. Connect Pi's GND pin to Breadboard - Rail.,Crucial:" Needs clean, stable 5V. Ensure the Buck Converter and battery can supply sufficient current (check Pi Zero 2W requirements, typically 2-3A peak)."
Arduino Nano,Buck Converter (5V Rail),Connect Nano's 5V (or VIN if powered from regulated 5V) pin to Breadboard + Rail. Connect GND pin to Breadboard - Rail.,Powered by the regulated 5V rail.
MPU6050 IMU,Buck Converter (5V Rail),Connect VCC to Breadboard + Rail. Connect GND to Breadboard - Rail.,Powered by 5V rail.
Ultrasonic Sensors (x2),Buck Converter (5V Rail),Connect VCC pin of each sensor to Breadboard + Rail. Connect GND pin of each sensor to Breadboard - Rail.,Powered by 5V rail.
IR Sensors (x4),Buck Converter (5V Rail),Connect VCC pin of each sensor to Breadboard + Rail. Connect GND pin of each sensor to Breadboard - Rail.,Powered by 5V rail.
Servo Motor (SG90),Buck Converter (5V Rail),Connect Red Wire (V+) to Breadboard + Rail. Connect Brown/Black Wire (GND) to Breadboard - Rail.,Caution:" SG90 servos can draw significant current, especially when stalling. Drawing this directly from the Nano's 5V pin or the Buck Converter might be risky if the power supply isn't robust enough. Consider a separate 5V supply or ensure your setup can handle the combined current draw. The Signal wire connects to Nano Pin D10."
L298N Motor Driver (Logic),Buck Converter (5V Rail),Connect VCC1 (Logic Supply) to Breadboard + Rail. Connect GND to Breadboard - Rail.,Powers the internal logic circuitry of the L298N.
L298N Motor Driver (Motors),Battery Pack,Connect VCC2 (Motor Supply +) directly to Battery Pack + (NOT through Buck Converter). Connect L298N GND (Motor Supply) to Battery Pack -. Ensure common ground between motor supply and logic supply (connect Battery - to Breadboard - Rail).,Powers the driving motors. Requires higher voltage/current than logic. Direct battery connection is necessary.
Driving Motors (x2),L298N Outputs,Connected to L298N output terminals (OUT1/OUT2" for Motor 1, "OUT3/OUT4 for Motor 2). Power comes via L298N.,Powered by the battery voltage through the L298N.
Start Button,Arduino Nano Internal Pull-up,One leg connects to Arduino Nano Pin D17 (A3). The other leg connects to Breadboard - Rail (GND).,Uses the Nano's internal pull-up resistor configuration ("pinMode(startPin, INPUT_PULLUP);"). No external power connection needed for the button itself.
